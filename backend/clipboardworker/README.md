## Clipboard mode

This is experimental feature and should have lived in a branch by itself but i accidentally commit it so here it is.. 

You do not need this part if you just want to use relaysecret tunnel & file sharing mode.

## About this experiment

I just want to play with KV storage to see how quickly it updates & sync so what's better than being able to quickly share what's in my clipboard with another computer! 

Note that: **it does not automatically grab the clipboard and uplodate it**, you do need to press a button to update & get the clipboard value between devices.
